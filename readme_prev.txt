TLine - Graphic Delphi component
Developed by Gon Perez-Jimenez. 2002-4th-April

Purpose:
Based on TGraphic Control, TLine allows you to create lines with/without arrows capabilities,
multidirection, ideal to create on execution graphic datagrams and so on.
Of course, TLine can be improved, but not by me.

License:
TLine is absolutely Freeware with NO Guarantee, but don't worry about it because this kind of
SW cann't damage any PC or anything else.

TLine is given to you as is. What you see is what you get...
If you modify the source code, please let me know results.
Enjoy it,
